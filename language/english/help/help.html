<h4 class="odd">Description</h4>
<p class="even">
QR is a module that supplies a variety of blocks displaying a QR code&reg;. These codes are most commonly used to share information via smartphones. 
The built in phone camera is used with a scanning 'app' to read the code, and take appropriate actions, such as offer to call or store
contact information, or launch a browser to a URL. All of the code generation occurs on your server, so no data leaves your site when 
using these blocks.

<h4 class="odd">Install/uninstall</h4>
<p class="even">
Normally, no special measures should be necessary, just follow the standard installation process. Extract the "qr" folder into the modules directory, and install the module through Administration Control Panel.</p>

<h4 class="odd">Security and Permissions</h4>
<p class="even">
You want to grant group access permissions to the QR module (not just for the blocks,) as it will not render a code without permission. 
In the module preferences you can also choose to check the referer when a request is made for a code to reduce the possibility of someone 
'leeching' QR images from your site.

<h4 class="odd">Preferences</h4>
<p class="even">
<ul style="padding-left:2em;" >
<li><b>Limit by Referer</b> - If set to "Yes," a simple check of the HTTP_REFERER will be made before generating any codes. This 
is intended to help reduce image leaching, which can be more costly since the code images are dynamically generated. But be aware, this
type of check may cause problems for legitimate users in some situations.</li>
<li><b>Error Correction Level</b> - Each QR Code includes error correction to recover from damage or distortions in the code. More error 
correction capability translates into larger code images. The default is level M, which is probably more than adequate for a screen
displayed image.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4 class="odd">Blocks</h4>
<p class="even">QR module provides 4 different blocks.
<ul style="padding-left:2em;" >
<li><b>Manual QR Code</b> - Displays a string as a code</li>
<li><b>MECARD</b> - coded contact data in docomo MECARD format</li>
<li><b>This Page QR Code</b> - Displays URL for the current page as a QR code&reg;. The URL includes only the specified page parameters in a 'get' type request.</li>
<li><b>This Page QR Code Block Extra</b> - as above, but uses a separate template (templates/blocks/qr_blockx_html) for special customizations. </li>
</ul>
<br />
Here is an example situation for the use of the <b>This Page QR Code Block Extra</b> block. QR codes are often used for sharing, 
so you might want one near the +1, Like, etc. buttons. You can edit templates/blocks/qr_blockx_html to add the needed html to
enable the other options, and voil&agrave; - a QR'ed share block.

<h4 class="odd">Direct Image Generation</h4>
<p class="even">
You can also generate a QR code&reg; png image outside of the supplied blocks using these scripts directly:<br />
<br />Generate code for any arbitrary data:<br />
<i>XOOPS_URL/modules/qr/getqrcode.php?qrdata=DATA+TO+ENCODE</i>
<br />
<br />
Generate MECARD code (name, email, url) for a XOOPS user:<br />
<i>XOOPS_URL/modules/qr/uidmecard.php?uid=nnn</i>
<br />
<br />
Generate MECARD code from structured data like this:<br />
<i>XOOPS_URL/modules/qr/getmecard.php?N=name&TEL=+15555551212&email=name@example.com</i>
<br />The following named request variables are interpred as MECARD
fields. These request variable names are accepted as either all
upper or all lower case (not mixed):

<ul style="padding-left:2em;" >
  <li>N <i>(name)</i></li>
  <li>SOUND <i>(kana)</i></li>
  <li>TEL <i>(phone number)</i></li>
  <li>TEL-AV <i>(video capable phone number)</i></li>
  <li>EMAIL <i>(email address)</i></li>
  <li>NOTE <i>(notes)</i></li>
  <li>BDAY <i>(birthday)</i></li>
  <li>ADR <i>(address)</i></li>
  <li>URL <i>(web site)</i></li>
  <li>NICKNAME <i>(nickname)</i></li>
</ul>
<br />
The N (name) is generally required by code scanners, and thus is 
required to generate a code. All other variables are optional, and 
will be used only if specified. Documentation for the MECARD format
can be found here:</br />

<h4 class="odd">Choosing Variables to Include in a QR URL</h4>
<p class="even">
Most dynamic content modules have id variables to control what the visitor sees. For example, you might have a news module 
that uses a variable 'storyid' to control which article is shown. The URL looks something like this:<br />
http://example.com/modules/news/view.php<b>?storyid=26</b><br />
The stuff that follows the '?' is our query string that contains the variables we are talking about. Now imagine further that 
the article, identified by storyid 26 is several pages long, so if you are looking at page two, the URL might look something like:<br />
http://example.com/modules/news/view.php<b>?storyid=26&amp;start=2</b><br />
To both keep the URL size small and to reduce the confusion which might occur by a shared link landing someone in the middle of a story 
we can make sure that the list contains 'storyid' but not 'start'. Optionally, you can also require that at least one variable from
your list is in the URL before a code is generated. One use for this is to make sure a code points to an article and not a index list 
or some other non-content page.

<h4 class="odd">Troubleshooting</h4>
<p class="even">
During installation, qr moves a directory "trust" to the trust path "/modules/qr" directory. If this operation does not complete 
cleanly, you may have to manually move these files. Check to see if the "trust" directory ('modules/qr/trust') still exists, and move it 
if needed. At the end of the installation, there should not be a trust directory in modules/qr. 

<p class="even">This failure will usually show in the install log as <em>Failed to execute xoops_module_install_qr</em>. 
The first thing to try is to make sure that the directory, XOOPS_TRUST_PATH/modules is writable, and then try to update the module. 
If this doesn't help, try to manually move the files as shown below.

<pre style="font-family: courier,mono;">
The files and directories below                      need to be moved to here

xoops_root_path/modules/qr/trust   ------->>> xoops_trust_path/modules/qr
                           | CHANGES.txt                               | CHANGES.txt
                           + data                                      + data
                           + image                                     + image
                           + perl                                      + perl
                           + php                                       + php
                           | README-e.txt                              | README-e.txt
                           | README.sjis                               | README.sjis
                           | README.txt                                | README.txt

</pre>
<p class="even">Depending on your system and how you move the folder, you may need to copy or move and then rename 'trust' to 'qr'.
