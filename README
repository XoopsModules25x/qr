Qr Module for XOOPS and ImpressCMS
==================================

This module adds QR Code(R) generating capabilities to a XOOPS or ImpressCMS site. Codes can be added to your site through blocks or by direct script calls.

This depends upon and includes Y.Swetake's excellent QRcode Perl CGI & PHP script ver.0.50i for actual code generation. For more information on the QRcode library scripts see:
<http://www.swetake.com/qr/index-e.html>

Version 1.2 of this module has been tested in XOOPS 2.5.5 and ImpressCMS versions 1.2.7 and 1.3.4.

This module was developed by Geekwright, LLC. Report any bugs or issues to <richard@geekwright.com>
